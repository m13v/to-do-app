        "comment": "This is such a perfect analogy! We're definitely still in the early days of reimagining interfaces for AI. With todoapp . ai, I'm trying to rethink task management from an AI-first perspective rather than just adding AI features to traditional to-do lists. The potential for completely new interaction paradigms is exciting."
