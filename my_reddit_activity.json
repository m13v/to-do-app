You're right; AI shouldn't be about flashy promises or vague empowerment slogans. Our aim is to help folks avoid the mind-numbing tasks like endless clicking and copy-pasting, not to replace them.\n\nWe believe in keeping things within the established processes to prevent issues like shadow IT and data leaks. If you're curious, check out what we're doing at mediar.ai. Always open to feedback and discussion."
