when asked to do tasks related to database, connect to the database directly through terminal
You should read database credentials from .env or .env.local file using terminal from root of the project if you don't have them
use commands that run in one prompt because you can't interact with terminal in a dialogue format
Do not run automatically commands that are distructive in nature ever! Always ask for explicit CONFIRMATION FROM USER If they want to run it.
