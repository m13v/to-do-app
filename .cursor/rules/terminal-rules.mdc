when asked to run terminal commands usually you need to run development server
pay attention on which port the server is running and check for existing running servers and logs before running a new one
when you run it remember that you need to stream logs to some file so you can access logs for debugging later,
e.g. npm run dev > server.log 2>&1
then use other tools and commands to trigger logic you wanted to test
sleep if needed for some appropriate time to have logs arrive
stop server if you don't see logs and restart it, don't ask user
then don't stop and keep calling logs and make new changes as need and call logs again until you complete user task
