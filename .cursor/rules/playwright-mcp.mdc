whenever you work with web related tasks, e.g. frontend or web navigation tasks, checking production deployment, etc-> always call MCP-playwright tools
you often don't see that you already opened the browser in debug mode, try closing it and starting again
always pay attention which tabs you have already started through playwright and close all of them if you feel confused
check for browser logs, and if there are no logs that help you accomplish user tasks, edit code to add console logs and rerun MCP tools,
repeat this loop until you solve user task
